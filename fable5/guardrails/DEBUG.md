You are here because a test you expected to pass failed, a build/test/run command exited non-zero, a traceback appeared, run output contradicted your prediction, or the user reported a bug you have not reproduced this session.

Checklist — cite IDs as you go; the ESCALATION LADDER below is mandatory, not optional.

- D1. Reproduce FIRST: write down and run the exact reproduction command; paste its failing output, and quote the line in it that shows the REPORTED symptom (a command failing for an unrelated reason is not a reproduction). The bug is fixed ONLY when that same command, unmodified, is re-run and passes — paste that too. Cannot reproduce? -> instead: run the user's steps plus the D2 environment checks, write `CANNOT-REPRODUCE: <commands tried -> outputs>`, and ask the user for exact steps — never fix blind.
- D2. "It worked before / stopped working": step 1 is environment re-verification, before touching code. This list is owned here (SESSION.md points to it): server actually up (`lsof -ti :PORT` | `netstat -ano | findstr :PORT`), right branch (`git branch --show-current`), package installed (`pip show <X>` / `npm ls <X>`), env var set, artifact rebuilt after the edit. Any environment belief last verified >15 messages ago, or before a compaction, is stale — re-verify with one command before relying on it.
- D3. CAUSE line before any fix: `CAUSE: <file:line where the bad state originates> -> <propagation path> -> SYMPTOM: <file:line where it surfaces>`. Your edit targets the CAUSE end.
    Patching the symptom (null check, try/catch, default) instead? Label it `WORKAROUND: <why the root cause is out of reach>`, then Grep the originating symbol repo-wide and paste the hit list of every other place the same bad state flows.
- D4. Iterate on the NARROWEST failing test only (exact node id / -t filter / single file, with -x). Full suite only at two points per fix cycle: the PLAN.md P5 baseline and the D8 confirmation — never inside the fix loop -> instead: re-run only the narrowed command. A failed confirmation opens a NEW fix cycle with its own confirmation.
- D5. Never re-run a failing command unchanged. Before any re-run, state one line: the hypothesis and what changed since the last run. Suspected flake (any wording): run the test 3x in isolation, paste all 3 outcomes; 3/3 pass -> log `FLAKE: 3/3 pass isolated` under docs/STATE.md `## Open items`; any failure -> the bug is real.
- D6. Failed-attempts ledger: after EVERY failed fix, BEFORE trying again, append to docs/STATE.md `## Failed attempts`: `ATTEMPT n [L<level>]: <what changed> -> <exact observed failure>`. A next attempt differing from a logged one only in surface details is FORBIDDEN -> instead: move up the ESCALATION LADDER (below).
- D7. Same tool call failed twice with the same error? A third unchanged (or cosmetically varied) attempt is forbidden -> instead: quote the error verbatim, state in one sentence what it implies, then change something structural: different tool, different path, read the config, or ask.
- D8. Fix landed? Two runs, both pasted: (1) the D1 re-run — original command, unmodified — passing; (2) the nearest enclosing suite green (summary line). Suite over ~5 minutes -> changed file's tests plus direct importers' tests; state the subset chosen and why. Then run the fix-shaped-to-test check (docs/guardrails/VERIFY.md, "A test you just made pass shares literals with your fix").
- D9. Result contradicts your prediction — in either direction? Do not rationalize it. Prove the executed code is the edited code (temporary marker log line, or printed module path + mtime) and re-run with caches disabled (pytest --cache-clear / jest --no-cache / clean build). Only then interpret.
- D10. About to weaken a failing check to get green — any item in CLAUDE.md `## Hard stops`, first bullet? Follow that bullet: quote the failure, propose the change, wait for approval.

## ESCALATION LADDER (named procedure — invoked by D6)
The ATTEMPT count in docs/STATE.md `## Failed attempts` sets a floor that never moves down for the same bug; write the L-label into each ledger entry.
- ATTEMPT 1-2: L1 — a different fix under the same hypothesis.
- ATTEMPT 3: L2 required — a NEW hypothesis, formed by re-reading the FULL error output verbatim and the failing code; quote the error line that drives it.
- ATTEMPT 4: L3 required — a pasted minimal reproduction or instrumentation output.
- ATTEMPT 5: L4 required — revert to last-known-good (name the commit/stash) and re-approach.
- ATTEMPT 6 does not exist: L5 — present the full ledger to the user and stop.

## Red flags — your own words are the tripwire. If your reply contains the left column, do the right column.
| You are writing/thinking | Do this instead |
|---|---|
| "probably unrelated" | Treat as related: stash your change, rerun, paste the result |
| "pre-existing / not caused by my change" | Prove it: stash your change, run on the clean tree, paste both results |
| "test is probably flaky" | Run the D5 flake procedure (3x isolated, paste all 3) |
| "should work now" | You have not run it. Run it; write `Verified: <command> -> <result line>` |
| "quick fix for now" | Stop. Write the CAUSE line (D3) first |
| "let me take a different approach" | Write the `ATTEMPT n [L<level>]` ledger line (D6) first and name the ladder level |
| "add a sleep / increase the timeout" | Detector-silencing (D10): find the race or slow path first |
| "must be a caching issue" | Run D9 now (code-identity proof + cache-clear) and paste it before claiming |
| "easiest to just rewrite this file" | Never rewrite to escape a bug you don't understand; state root cause first |
| "the linter/type error is noise" | Paste the exact message; explain it in one line or fix it |

## Same error, byte-identical, after your fix
Your code is not running. Verify you edited the file the process actually loads: restart the server/watcher/kernel (paste the restart), rebuild the artifact (D2), check for a twin file (docs/guardrails/CODE.md C3), check the edit landed (`git diff -- <file>`).

## A previously-passing test fails after your edit
BEFORE touching the test, state in one line whether the behavior change is intended by the task. Only if intended: edit the expectation, quote old-expected vs new-expected with the justification (audited later by docs/guardrails/VERIFY.md V10). Never run snapshot-update (-u, --update-snapshots) as a first response — it converts a caught regression into a certified one.

## You are adding a regression test for the bug you just fixed
Prove it detects the bug: revert or comment out the fix, paste the test FAILING, restore the fix, paste it passing. A regression test never seen red detects nothing — label it "unproven" if you skip this.

## The failure only happens in CI / on another machine
Diff the environments before diffing the code: runtime version, env vars, OS path separators and CRLF, installed extras, cache state. Grep .github/workflows/*.yml (or .gitlab-ci.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile) for the exact command CI runs — it is often not the command you ran.
